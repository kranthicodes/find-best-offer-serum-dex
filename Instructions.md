# Blockchain Engineer Code Challenge

## Project

The purpose of this project is to create an application that displays the exchange rate for a particular asset pair presented on [Serum](https://www.projectserum.com). You can choose to build any type of interface — it could be a React web app, a server exposing an endpoint or even a CLI utility.

Work on this challenge as you would work as a member of a development team. Consider the other devs that will review your code as your teammates in this project.

Please **do not** work more than 8 hours on this without checking in with us to see if you're on the right path. We don't want to waste your time.

### User Journey

- The user chooses a pair of assets (e.g. SOL/USDT), called "From" and "To" assets.
- The app displays the best offer from an orderbook either for asks, bids or both (e.g. “Buy 185.4/Sell 185.7”)

### Bonus Track

- The user enters an amount of the "From" asset.
- The amount is taken into account when fetching the best offer.

## Rules

 - Implement in JavaScript
 - You can use ANY 3rd-party npm library
 - You can use ANY public Solana RPC APIs
 - Your solution must stay in sync with the Solana blockchain so the exchange rates should update accordingly to the orderbook
 - The interface should present the exchange rates in an approachable and easy-to-understand way

## Code Guidelines
